This is not a replacement for the lab instructions. Please only use this as mental scaffolding, as it's not meant to have comprehensive information on the topic.

For a detailed explanation on each step, click the Step Number, which will redirect you to a page with the explanation. Your checkboxes should be preserved if you use the back arrow to return to this page, but you can also control+shift+click the links to open them in a new page.

<input type="checkbox"> Step 1: Read through pages 87-91. (Please actually do this)<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Step 2: Observe Table 5-3 and note how the B, SB, H, and SH letters affect the LDR instruction.<br>
<input type="checkbox"> [Step 3](./step3.md): Read pages 95-96. "Wrap" the given code in the starting and ending code you have seen in previous labs. <br>
<input type="checkbox"> [Step 4](./step4.md): Compile the code from Step 3.**After completing this step, take a screenshot of your code from Step 3 and the terminal showing that it compiles 




## Conclusion
- 
- If you have any more questions, specific or general, make sure to ask a TA.
- If you have any suggestions for this site, email me at **[cshapard@smu.edu](mailto:cshapard@smu.edu).** I made this last night, so I couldn't include as much as I wanted to, but it will be better for next week's lab. Let me know what you want to see/what would help you most!
