# Explanation
To do this step, make sure you have a Makefile in the same directory(a.k.a. folder) as your new code. I don't have my own Pitaya nor a copy of the book, so I can't list the code here yet, but just copy over your Makefile from a previous lab and replace the names of the old files with the name of your new file.
