# Coop's Microcontroller Guide

## Microcontrollers are hard.
There's really no debate there. I'm a TA, and they still confuse me at times. But that doesn't mean that they're not worth learning.

By now, you probably know that these devices often bring much sorrow and confusion. My goal is to change that. I created this website as a way of teaching you everything you need to know to be successful in ECE 1381/1181. The guide assumes no prior knowledge on any of these concepts and seeks to provide you with the resources to succeed.

I'm writing this whole thing from scratch as of 10pm yesterday, so I only had time to make one lesson (Lab 4), but hopefully by next week, I will have the whole website decked out with lessons like "How to use the Terminal: a guide made for people who have no clue where to even begin with the Command Line", "Red Pitaya Errors: a nearly comprehensive list of errors you will come across and how to gracefully fix them", "Code organization: how to not get lost in a heap of files (and how to not write the same code over and over)", and many more.

If you all would like me to deck out this website with the above features and more, please let me know. Email me at **[cshapard@smu.edu](mailto:cshapard@smu.edu)** with your suggestions/anything you think would be helpful for your learning. I truly want you all to understand this material, so I will be working hard to fill this out as much as I can over the next few weeks.

In the meantime, check out my documentation for [Lab 4](Lab4). After working through it, please email me some feedback on what you liked, what you didn't like, what you want to see in the future, and any improvements to formatting/ease of use you can think of. I won't be checking who sends things (and honestly I don't know most of your names), so the feedback is relatively anonymous. You can send your feedback from a junk email address if you don't want your name attached to it. I just genuinely want to know what helps you guys the most.

Also, odds are that you'll get a 404 page at some point since I made this last night and didn't account for any errors. The 404 page redirects here, so if you want a quick link back to lab 4:
