# Explanation
I'm so sorry my computer is at 6% and I don't have my charger. I won't be able to fill this part out in time. It should be almost identical to **[Step 10](./step10.md)**, except that you are comparing STR instructions instead of LDR. ALSO: Instead of checking the value using `i r`, you'll need to check the memory location (stored in R1) using the command from step 7. If you have questions, let me know!
