**Warning: Closing this page will clear your checkboxes**

This is not a replacement for the lab instructions. Please only use this as mental scaffolding, as it's not meant to have comprehensive information on the topic.

For a detailed explanation on each step, click the Step Number, which will redirect you to a page with the explanation. Your checkboxes should be preserved if you use the back arrow to return to this page, but you can also control+shift+click the links to open them in a new page.

<input type="checkbox"> Step 1: Read through pages 87-91. (Please actually do this)<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Step 2: Observe Table 5-3 and note how the B, SB, H, and SH letters affect the LDR instruction.<br>
<input type="checkbox"> [Step 3](./step3.md): Read pages 95-96. "Wrap" the given code in the starting and ending code you have seen in previous labs. <br>
<input type="checkbox"> [Step 4](./step4.md): Compile the code from Step 3.**After completing this step, take a screenshot of your code from Step 3 and the terminal showing that it compiles with no errors.**<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Step 5: Run the debugger with your new code.<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Step 6: Check the content of register R1.<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Step 7: Use the command `x /4ubfx ContentsOfR1` to check what is stored in the memory address held in R1. **After completing this step, take a screenshot showing the values stored at R1's memory address.** These should be in the reverse order of the values you had in the "mynumber" line because of Little Endianness.<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Step 8: Step over the next line of code and make sure R2 contains the reverse of the value you saw in R1 (aka, the same order as "mynumber").<br>
<input type="checkbox"> [Step 9](./step9.md): Change "mynumber" to your student ID in hexadecimal and disassemble your program. **After this step, take a screeenshot showing the disassembled code. In your lab report, note which memory addresses hold your student ID. <br>
