# Explanation
#### Student ID in Hex
To transfer your student ID from Decimal to Hex, simply prefix it with "0x".<br>
So, if your student ID is "12345678", then it would be "0x12345678" in hex.

#### Remake the program
Use the commands you have been using throughout this semester to "remake" the program. Make sure to include the `DEBUG=1` in the line `make -B DEBUG=1`!

#### Disassemble the program
I don't have my own Pitaya nor a copy of the book, and I don't remember the exact command. I believe you used it last lab, so check the book section from there. I believe it was something along the lines of `objdump YourFileName`, but fact check me on that. If you find it, let me know and I'll update this page for the other students.
